## About the website

This site reposits the code snippets which are reusable for data analysis and visualization written in Python and R. Most of them are bioinformatics relevant.

## About me
I am a PhD student in HZI working on microbime and bioinformatics. Massive NGS data processing, statistics, data visualization are my daily work which I found is fun for me. For my daily work, I use Python, R, Linux shell, Golang.
